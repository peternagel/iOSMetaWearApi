 Each MBLMetaWear object corresponds a physical MetaWear board.  It contains all the logical
 methods you would expect for interacting with the device, such as, connecting, disconnecting,
 reading and writing state.
 
 Sensors and peripherals on the MetaWear are encapsulated within their own objects accessable 
 here via properties.  For example, all accelerometer functionality is contained in the 
 MBLAccelerometer class and is accessed using the accelerometer property
